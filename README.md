# Android MVP (Model-View-Presenter) Architecture Basic Sample

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the MVP architecture pattern used in Android development. MVP separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Presenter, each with distinct responsibilities to enhance code maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Components

### Model

The **Model** represents the data and business logic of the application.  

### View

The **View** is responsible for presenting the user interface and handling user interactions. 

### Presenter

The **Presenter** acts as the intermediary between the Model and View.
